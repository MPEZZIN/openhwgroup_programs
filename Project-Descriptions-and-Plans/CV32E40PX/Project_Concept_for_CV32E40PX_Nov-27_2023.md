# OpenHW Project Concept Proposal: CV32E40PX
*The PC proposal introduces the project and explains the market drivers and the "why"*

# Title of Project - "CV32E40PX"
# Project Concept Proposal
## Date of proposal - 2023-11-27 (updated 2023-12-04)
## Author(s) - Manuel PEZZIN (CEA)

## High Level Summary of project, project components, and deliverables
The objective of this project is to have a new CPU core tailored for deeply embedded
real-time control/DSP workloads.

Target TRL is TRL4 or TRL5 (idealy TRL5 if we are able to find enough verification resources).

Main goal of this project is to provide a new CPU core that supports official RVB
(and a part of RVK) and (upcoming) RVP extensions while keeping functional backward
compatibility with CV32E40Pv1/v2 (eg XPULP custom extensions are kept and even extended).

Additionnal features may also be considered, like:
* CV-X-IF support
* CLIC support
* Improved OBI interface support (bus error in particular)

Thus, it will extend existing features from CV32E40P with a subset of CV32E40X ones,
and will extend them further with RVP support in particular.

This new project will keep functional backward compatibility with CV32E40P (v1/v2),
but with relaxed rules on changes compared to the previous project.
In particular, formal logic equivalence with the previous design will not be required
to make design work easier. We will try as much as possible to maintain a formal
sequential equivalence for backward-compatible configurations.

## Summary of market or input requirements


### Known market/project requirements at PC gate

**Priority 1 features and design changes (Mandatory, will be implemented)**

Keep XPULP custom extensions that improve address manipulations and flow control:
* Post-increment and register-register indexed load/store
* Hardware loops
* Immediate branch
* Event load

Add support for RISC-V official bit manipulation instructions (RVB/RVK):
* RVB zba (address manipulation) will be supported
* RVB zbb (basic bit manipulations) will be supported
* RVB zbs (single bit instructions) will be supported
* RVB zbc (carry-less multiplications) : may be supported, to be confirmed if
  relevant for DSP applications
* RVK zbkb (Bitmanip instructions for Cryptography) : pack, packh, packw, brev8,
  zip, unzip additionnal instructions may be supported, if relevant for DSP applications
* RVK zbkx (Crossbar permutation instructions) : xpem4 and xperm8 additionnal
  instructions may be supported, if relevant for DSP applications
* RVK zkn, zks, zkr and zkt are specific to cryptographic computations and will not be supported

Add support for RISC-V official DSP instructions (RVP):
* Q-format
* Result averaging/rounding/saturation
* SIMD (8, 16 and 32-bit data)
  * Parrallel addition/subtraction/...
  * Multiply and multiply-accumulate
  * Crossed operations
  * Dot product
  * Register pair operands
* Widening operations (full result stored in register pair)
* 64 bits addition/subtraction

note: Since RVP extensions are not ratified yet, this list is not exhaustive.

Introduce a dual opcode scheme for XPULP ALU instructions that have a strict RVB/RVP equivalent:
* Multiply-accumulate
* General ALU extensions
* Bit manipulation
* SIMD (16 and 8-bit data)

note : this dual opcode scheme allows backard compatibility and open the door to smooth transition
of existing programs from XPULP to RVB/RVP, if needed/relevant.

Floating Point Unit:
* keep current CV-FPU integration unchanged as much as possible. If a design modification is envisioned,
sequential equivalence with CV32E40Pv2 is required.

**Priority 2 features and design changes (Optionnal, would be implemented if we have enough design/verification resources)**

Introduce XPULPv3 custom extentions (preliminary, feature list may evolve):
* ALU instructions that have a strict RVB/RVP equivalent opcode will be deprecated, new XPULPv3 opcodes will be RVB/RVP ones instead
* Deprecate single operand *abs* instruction in favor of dual operand *pdif* (RVP superset of abs useful for manhattan distance computation)
* Deprecate single operand *cv.cplxconj* instruction in favor of dual operand *pas* (RVP parallel add-sub)
* Deprecate *cv.cplxmul.r* and *cv.cplxmul.i* in favor of a single instruction *cv.cplxmul* that computes both parts of complex multiplication
* Introduce hermitian form of *cv.cplxmul* (rs1 x conj(rs2)) ? (widely used in DSP computation for telecom applications)
* *this list may be completed / updated during design phase, if useful contributions are proposed*

Add CV-X-IF interface:
* End user product may require additionnal appliance-specific custom instructions, these instructions should be implemented in a co-processor.

Add CLIC support:
* Core-local interrupt controller fits better with embedded real-time requirements than PLIC or any other (non RISC-V compliant)
  external interrupt controller that requires a 2-step interrupt handling code.

Design Portability:
* EDA tools parser bug work-arounds: current design coding style is standard-compliant, but EDA tools may
  have bugs that prevent proper reading. Design should be parsed with several EDA tools and offending RTL code should be fixed.

### Potential future design enhancements
* remove deprecated features
* Add Zce extension for further code-size reduction.
* Add bus attributes support.
* move bitmanip, SIMD and complex number subsets of XPULP, RVB/RVK and RVP to a CV-X-IF compliant co-processor IP
  * pros : this will make these features available to other processors, and would simplify verification work.
  * cons : a performance loss is expected on instructions that use register pairs.

## Who would make use of OpenHW output
Companies needing performant, energy-efficient (deeply) embedded real-time control and/or DSP applications with code size constrains.

## Initial Estimate of Timeline
At Project Concept:
* Preliminary RTL code drop expected in 2024-Q1
* RTL feature-complete expected in end of 2024-Q4 / 2025-Q1
* RTL freeze and verification completed expected end of 2025-Q4

## Explanation of why OpenHW should do this project
This proposal is a continuation of CV32E40P project.
Main goal is to support official RVB (and a part of RVK) and (upcoming) RVP
extensions while keeping backward compatibility with CV32E40Pv1/v2.
One key advantage of supporting official RVB/RVP extensions is versatility and
compatibility with a larger set of framework and applications. This will also allow
users to use upstream version of compilation toolchain.

XPULP custom extensions may also be extended to benefit from design enhancements
introduced for RVB and RVP support.

Additionnal features may also be considered, like CV-X-IF and CLIC support.

Improved OBI interface support (bus error in particular) is also envisionned.

Keeping backward compatibility will allow existing users of CV32E40Pv2 to migrate
smoothly their existing products to this new version of the core, while keeping
the benefits of existing custom extensions.
In addition, keeping XPULP custom extensions will offer improvements to address
manipulation, flow control and complex numbers computations.

* RVB, RVK, CLIC, ans CV-X-IF being supported by CV32E40X, existing test suite may be reused/adapted
* RVP verification workload difficult to evaluate for the moment
